Our project is a time zone calculator used to put in 2 different places and time zones and calculate the difference. A problem that all 3 of us struggle with is the scheduling of time when we have meetings with people in other parts of the world. For example, some of our relatives live in different parts of the world. When we call from 3 PM here, it could be around 3 AM where they live. We built this website to create an easy-to-use app for people around the world to meet with each other.
